Hello Judges!!! 
here is my solo team contribute. 

My interest and main focus was : 
Could I learn basic interaction with MUD Sky Strife plugins layers - stable Mainnet version. Then I should be or..  I will be able to develop tools for SkyStrife ogg's players to be able beat 1v3.
First tool what I miss for my fingers and heptic fights is Headquarter for my units:

My idea was step by step prepare plugin core for fully automated bot challenges. Source was Sky Strife plugins examples. Dream need to be sometime also short to be able to happens. :) 

Target of plugin :
   
Default hotkeys pre-setup for Headquarter to help coordinate unit groups Fortified and Frenzy modes with different automated strategy. Right now is ready for trial against other players as tool to give potential advantage in correct usage. It's only partially tested on local dev. 

- "f"  fortified units list - add/remove selected units to list visualised on left side of plugin window : 
 on second half of turn init defend attack against bestTarget in range of attack without move.  !!! prio *1 done

- "F"  frenzy units list - add/remove selected units to list visualised on rigth side of plugin window : 
 on second half of turn init frenzy attack with move.  !!! prio *1

- Basic userfriendly features:  visualised selectedEntity on list in yellow mark , if click on entity on list unit selection happens,

- "r" frenzy defend action hotkey:  
 selected units attack bestTarget without any move

 - "R" frenzy run action hotkey: - original version frenzy
 selected units attack bestTarget with potential move 
_______________________________________________________________________________

Then I feel bad without Hotkey Btn's line: 

Default hotkey setup for symbols 0-9 to be able fast selection pre-set entity, btn's are setable if selected entity and first attemps by hotkey's 0-9 or later by selected entity and click on btn in plugin window by mouse click.Add feature with Sprite Icon -> is updated on this btn if entity pre-set any time.

Thank you be spending a time on my crappy text/code. ;)
