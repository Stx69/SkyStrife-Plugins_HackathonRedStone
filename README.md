HQ - Army - 

Target of plugin :

1. I would like to learn basic interaction with MUD Sky Strife plugins layers - stable Mainnet version. Main focus build tools for Hardcore SkyStrife ogg's players to be able beat 1v3.
   
2. Build hotkeys HeadQuarter to help coordinate unit groups Fortified and Frenzy use diferent automated strategy:

My idea was step by step prepare plugin core for fully automated bot challenges. Source was Sky Strife plugins examples. Dream need to be sometime also short to be able to happens. :)  

HeadQuarter - Army description: 
right now is ready for trial against other players as tool to give potential advantage in correct usage. It's only partially tested in local dev. 

Hotkeys functions and setup:

- "f"  fortified units list - add/remove selected units to list visualised on left side of plugin window : 
 on second half of turn init defend attack against bestTarget in range of attack without move.  !!! prio *1 done

- "F"  frenzy units list - add/remove selected units to list visualised on rigth side of plugin window : 
 on second half of turn init frenzy attack with move.  !!! prio *1

- "r" frenzy defend action hotkey:  - not started yet
 selected units attack bestTarget without any move

 - "R" frenzy run action hotkey: - original version frenzy - works well
 selected units attack bestTarget with potential move 

3. Hotkey Btn's line for symbols 0-9 for fast selection pre-set entity, btn's are setable if selected entity and first attemps by hotkey's 0-9 or later by selected entity and click on btn in plugin window by mouse click. Sprite Icon is set on this btn if entity pre-set.
